# Example

The files in the [/models](/example/models) folder are generated from the configuration file in this folder.
They are built from an instance of the [Sample Database](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-sample-database/) from www.postgresqltutorial.com.

The example uses the Zod extension to generate [Zod](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod) schemas as well. You can see those at the bottom of each file.
